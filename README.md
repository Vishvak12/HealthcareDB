## 1. Introduction
The HealthCare Database Management System (DBMS) is a Java-based application for managing healthcare-related data. This system is designed to help healthcare facilities, hospitals, and clinics efficiently store, retrieve, and manage patient information, medical records, and other relevant data. The DBMS utilizes Java for its user interface and SQL for data storage and retrieval.

## 2. Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication system to control access to the system.
- **Patient Management**: Maintain comprehensive patient records, including personal details, medical history, and treatment records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule and manage patient appointments with healthcare providers.
- **Medical Record Storage**: Store and retrieve medical records, diagnostic reports, and prescriptions.
- **Billing and Invoicing**: Generate and manage invoices and bills for patients.
- **Inventory Management**: Track and manage healthcare facility inventory and supplies.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate various reports and analytics to gain insights into healthcare operations.

## 3. Installation
To run the HealthCare DBMS, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
   - Set up a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-dbms.git](https://github.com/Vishvak12/HealthcareDB.git
   cd healthcare-dbms
   ```

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - Create a new database for the application in your RDBMS.
   - Update the database configuration settings in the `config.properties` file.

4. **Compile and Run**:
   - Compile and run the Java application:
     ```
     javac -cp .:mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar Appointment.java
     java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar HealthCareDBMS
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/healthcare`.

## 4. Usage
The HealthCare DBMS provides an intuitive user interface for managing healthcare-related data. Users can log in, create and manage patient records, schedule appointments, access medical records, and perform various administrative tasks.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the user manual provided with the application.

## 5. Database Schema
The database schema used in the application includes tables for patients, appointments, medical records, billing, inventory, and user accounts. You can find the database schema in the `Healthcare.7z` zip folder within the project.
